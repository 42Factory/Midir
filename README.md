Midir Project
==========

Arduino based simple and modulable system to get environments information using multiple sensors

### Consists of :
1. Arduino gets informations from sensors
2. If a SD card is plugged, the arduino write them on it
3. Else, it send them to a ThingSpeak server trough an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module

### Components
- In our case, an Arduino Mega 2560 was used
- To supply enough current to feed the ESP8266 (200mA needed vs 30mA providen by the 3v3 Mega's pin) and to make sure to get a regular 3v3 and 5v circuits for our sensor, we used a MB102 regulator and a 9V/2A power supply to serve our system.
- An ESP8266 module to send datas to a ThingSpeak server trough Wi-Fi
- A SD Card module to save datas if no Wi-Fi network is available
- And RTC DS3231 module to keep the clock time and write it on the SD Card with datas

F.A.Q
====================

## How do I edit the program on the Arduino ?

To edit an Arduino sketch, you will need the Arduino IDE available at this address : [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software "Arduino IDE Download")
Download and install it.

If it's your first time manipulating Arduino systems, we recommand you to follow these **Getting started** steps on the [Arduino Official Website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software "Arduino Getting started")

Open the **midir.ino** file and start coding.

## How do I add my sensor to the Sensorbox on the Arduino ?

First, you need to know if your sensor module use direct analogic value or I2C, UART, etc. connection.
Referr to the constructor page and try to get information about how does it work.

For example, we will add a **BMP180** Barometric Pressure/Temperature/Altitude Sensor bought on [Adafruit](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software "Adafruit BMP180") to our SensorBox

### Connection

According to the BMP180 Adafruit page, this board is 5V compliant - a 3.3V regulator and a i2c level shifter circuit is included so you can use this sensor safely with 5V logic and power.
Connect the VIN pin to the 5V voltage pin, GND to ground, SCL to I2C Clock (Analog 5) and SDA to I2C Data (Analog 4)

### Library

Download the Adafruit BMP085/BMP180 Arduino library and example code for temperature, pressure and altitude calculation [**Here**](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-BMP085-Library "Adafruit BMP085/BMP180 Library") (Click on **Download ZIP**)
Unzip it and move it into your installation folder.
First, we will test our sensor apart, so load the example sketch (**.ino** file).
Then install the library :

![Importing Arduino Library](http://www.codevista.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Importing-Arduino-Library.png "Importing Arduino Library")

You should have something like this at this point : 

You should have precision temperature, pressure and altitude data in the Serial Monitor
